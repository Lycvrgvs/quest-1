# Future Tasks

- Refine and expand the app's texts and examples using the Quest 1 and Quest 2 documents on Google Drive.
- Add an "El segundo paso" menu for Quest 2 explaining how to forge a routine and how to forge an identity. When users open Modify Mission during quest2-mision2, the section called "primer paso" should switch to "el segundo paso".
- Include the six evidence types in the Oracle icon and reposition the Guia button so it doesn't feel sandwiched between Habito and Evidence, improving the UX.
- Review the design against the Material Design system, using the Material 3 expressive style. Compare it with the Beta 1 design to create a complete design system and dev-guide that follows the Odyssey narrative with a visual aesthetic.
- Explore how to implement AI and AX (agent experience) to help people when they do something wrong, have questions or confusion about the system, and to assist with onboarding into the Quest app.
